# mlb-react

## Requirements
This project was built with ReactJS, a JavaScript framework maintained by Facebook. Much of the code was extended from the React comment box example from [the ReactJS tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html).

## Instructions
Within the mlb-react folder, install Node modules and Bower components by running the following in command line:
```
npm install
bower install
```
Now fire up your Node.js server:
```
node server.js
```
Open ```localhost:3000``` in a browser.
